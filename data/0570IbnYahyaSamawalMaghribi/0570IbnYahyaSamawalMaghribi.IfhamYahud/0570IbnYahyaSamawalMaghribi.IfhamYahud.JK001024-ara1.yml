90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: PV added structural annotation
    (and added the kitāb titles from the edition, which were not in the digital version).
    This version seems superior to the Ṭawīla edition, because it also includes
    the autobiography of the author and the letter sent to him, 
    which are a feature of the manuscript tradition. In the Ṭawīla edition,
    only part of the autobiography is included in the editor's introduction,
    and the letter is added in the digital version but not originally in the edition.
